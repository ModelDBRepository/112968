Kuznetsova AY, Deth RC (2008) A model for modulation of neuronal
synchronization by D4 dopamine receptor-mediated phospholipid
methylation. J Comput Neurosci 24:314-29

Abstract:

We describe a new molecular mechanism of dopamine-induced membrane
protein modulation that can tune neuronal oscillation frequency to
attention related gamma rhythm.  This mechanism is based on the unique
ability of D4 dopamine receptors (D4R) to carry out phospholipid
methylation (PLM) that may affect the kinetics of ion channels.  We
show that by deceasing the inertia of the delayed rectifier potassium
channel, a transition to 40 Hz oscillations can be achieved.
Decreased potassium channel inertia shortens spike duration and
decreases the interspike interval via its influence on the
calcium-dependent potassium current.  This mechanism leads to a
transition to attention-related gamma oscillations in a pyramidal
cell-interneuron network.  The higher frequency and better
synchronization is observed with PLM affecting pyramidal neurons only,
and recurrent excitation between pyramidal neurons is important for
synchronization.  Thus dopamine-stimulated methylation of membrane
phospholipids may be an important mechanism for modulating firing
activity, while impaired methylation can contribute to disorders of
attention.
